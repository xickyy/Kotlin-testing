Lets Get itttt

using the "sealed" tag in front of class declaration means that when using a When statement withinh the class that an else must always be specified... another thing is that there will be a limited number of subclasses that can be created bron the parent class that must be defined within the parent class.


annotation tags in front of the class declaration are used so that you can use that class to describe your code. so that you can provide custom errors for when other programers see or use your code they can get a detailed error created by you explaining what went wrong or explain how something is meant to be used.
